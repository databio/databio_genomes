# Asset PEP

This is a [PEP](https://pepkit.github.io) for building our lab's reference genome assets with refgenie. The contents are:

- `assets.csv` - The primary sample_table. Each each row is an asset. 
- `recipe_inputs.csv` - The subsample_table. This provides a way to define each individual value passed to any of the 3 arguments of the `refgenie build` command: `--assets`, `--params`, and `--files`. 
- `refgenie_build_cfg.yaml` -- config file that defines the subprojects (which are used to download the input data) and additional project settings.

## Building assets using this PEP

### Step 1: Download input files

To programmatically download all the files required by `refgenie build`, run from this directory:

```
looper run refgenie_build_cfg.yaml --compute local --sp getfiles
```

### Step 2: Build assets

To build all the assets specified in the sample_table (`assets.csv`), run:

```
looper run refgenie_build_cfg.yaml
```

This will create one job for each *asset*.

## Adding an asset to this PEP

### Step 1: Add the asset to the asset table.

To add an asset, you will need to add a row in `assets.csv`. Follow these directions:

- `sample_name` - just use `{genome}-{asset_name}` for now
- `genome` - the human-readable genome (namespace) you want to serve this asset under
- `asset_name` - the human-readble asset name you want to serve this asset under. It is often, but not necessarily, identical to the `asset_recipe`.
- `asset_recipe` - the unique identifier for the recipe you want to build (use `refgenie list` to see [available recipes](http://refgenie.databio.org/en/latest/build/))

Your asset will be retrievable from the server with `refgenie pull {genome}/{asset_name}`.

### Step 2: Add any required inputs to the recipe_inputs table

Next, we need to add the source for each item required by your recipe. You can see what the recipe requires by using `-q` or `--requirements`, like this: `refgenie build {genome}/{recipe} -q`. If your recipe doesn't require any inputs, then you're done. If it requires any inputs (which can be one or more of the following: *assets*, *files*, *parameters*), then you need to specify these in the `recipe_inputs.csv` table.

For each required input, you add a row to `recipe_inputs.csv`. Follow these directions:
- `sample_name` - must match the row name in `assets.csv`. This is how we match inputs to assets.

Next you will need to fill in one or more of the 3 _pairs of columns_: 
- `files_id` and `files_value`, if your recipe requires a files input. The `id` field must match the recipe requirement.
- `assets_id` and `assets_value`, if your recipe requires assets input. The `id` field must match the recipe requirement.
- `params_id` and `params_value`, if your recipe requires a params input. The `id` field must match the recipe requirement.
